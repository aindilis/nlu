(The idea is to use a system similar to the GnuGo for
 interpretting text.  A pattern based system that suggests
 potential semantic representations for a given piece of text
 based on common patterns - it then "reads" (as in go) the
 situation with various search algorithms to determine if this is
 indeed the best approach.  perhaps use forward chaining so that
 new data given can be incorporated.)

(perhaps it could give example data structures that satisfy the
 required properties of a textual snippet, for instance, "semantic
representation" could consist of a reference to an actual
 semantic representation, just as one pops into mind when we hear
 the term.  Also, properties known to apply to "semantic
representation" could also be listed, such as, "usually in a
formal language", etc.)

("pops into mind" is idiom)


(In just rereading this now, it got me wondering if we shouldn't
 do abduction over all the kinds of potential models available.
 For instance, the semantics of what we are reading may be full
 second order, and so we would have to have the ability to pull
 out second order statements as a model of what is being read.
 If the problems exhibited higher order, we would need higher
 order.  In general we have to simulate to some extent the
 reality.  In general again maybe we need to have abduction over
 turing machines.  Very difficult, of course, but this might need
 to be the representational language.

 (so this makes one think of ILP, perhaps we could use logicmoo
  or other libraries of prolog predicates for that.)
