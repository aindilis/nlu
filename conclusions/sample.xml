      What's the difference between "perl" and "Perl"?  One bit. Oh, you
      weren't talking ASCII? :-) Larry now uses "Perl" to signify the
      language proper and "perl" the implementation of it, i.e. the
      current interpreter. Hence Tom's quip that "Nothing but perl can
      parse Perl."  You may or may not choose to follow this usage. For
      example, parallelism means "awk and perl" and "Python and Perl"
      look OK, while "awk and Perl" and "Python and perl" do not. But
      never write "PERL", because perl is not an acronym, apocryphal
      folklore and post-facto expansions notwithstanding.

      Illustrated by Thomas Fogarty

      THE BALTIMORE SUNâ€”Once m a great many years there is published a book that
      stands out so pre-eminently above the general run of books that it deserves to

      Seumas MacManus' Yourself and i-,-.e Neighbours.
