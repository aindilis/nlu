Contradiction on the use of Perl versus PERL.  Need to note these
things.

What's the difference between "perl" and "Perl"?  One bit. Oh, you
weren't talking ASCII? :-) Larry now uses "Perl" to signify the
language proper and "perl" the implementation of it, i.e. the current
interpreter. Hence Tom's quip that "Nothing but perl can parse Perl."
You may or may not choose to follow this usage. For example,
parallelism means "awk and perl" and "Python and Perl" look OK, while
"awk and Perl" and "Python and perl" do not. But never write "PERL",
because perl is not an acronym, apocryphal folklore and post-facto
expansions notwithstanding.
