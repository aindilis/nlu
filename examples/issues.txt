Then the two main parts of the sentence are analysed further, and the
pronoun “it” triggers a rule which at once deals with the pronoun's
lexical content and its context dependence; i.e. it says that we must
select a new discourse referent, link it to a discourse referent made
available by the preceding discourse, and update the DRS so as to
record these changes.

What are the function of the quotes around "it"?

------------------------------------------------------

In two-level versions of DRT there is no such rule

What is connoted by two-level?  what kinds of items can be created in
this way, how should they be parsed?

------------------------------------------------------

4. The DRS language: syntax, semantics, accessibility

How do we deal with sections like the above - how do we encode and
conversely generate that representation in various contexts?
