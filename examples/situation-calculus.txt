The situation calculus is a logic formalism designed for representing and reasoning about dynamical domains. It was first introduced by 
John McCarthy in 1963. The main version of the situational calculus that is presented in this article is based on that introduced by Ray
Reiter in 1991. It is followed by sections about McCarthy's 1986 version and a logic programming formulation.

A simple robot world will be modeled as a running example. In this world there is a single robot and several inanimate objects. The world
is laid out according to a grid so that locations can be specified in terms of (x,y) coordinate points. It is possible for the robot to
move around the world, and to pick up and drop items. Some items may be too heavy for the robot to pick up, or fragile so that they break
when they are dropped. The robot also has the ability to repair any broken items that it is holding.

The main difference between the original situation calculus by
McCarthy and Hayes and the one in use today is the interpretation of
situations.
