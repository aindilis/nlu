Example 6. Suppose we want to work with a 2-dimensional logic combining a
modality 2k of knowledge with a modality 2b of belief. Moreover, suppose we
model 2k as an S5 modality and 2b as an D45 modality and let us furthermore
add two axioms characterizing their relationship. We may then want to check
whether or not 2k and 2b coincide, i.e., whether 2k includes 2b:
