From my Sine Spiral Graphing work I understand the well known equation
E=MC^2 to mean that Energy is proportional to the inversely
proportional values of Mass and the Speed of light rotating in two
perpendicular dimensions: X and Y around Z the timeline of the
Mass. In a recursive helix timeline simulation, increasing the
exponent by adding more variables would increase the complexity of the
motion.
