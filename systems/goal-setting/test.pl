# given a piece of text, set a goal to understand it, wrt some kind of
# context

# phenomenon that must be accounted for
# "I know what you meant"

# given the entry, set a goal to understand the context



# have metadata about the file, what kind of file is it, where did it
# come from, what are the files near it, how does it stand in relation
# to those files (is it part of an archive containing them, etc)

# understand the text in context

# understand the sentence

# resolve all entities in the sentence

# extract all definitive relationships

# map the structure of whatever argument is being made, and if it is
# not an argument, annotate the function

# if knowledge should be asserted, assert it

# if action is required, act

# specify the context frame of the text, so for instance, we would not
# act on something in quotations usually

# have the felicitous function that sees if things sound right, so for
# instance, you can piece together text that has been separated by for
# instance a code comment symbol


# develop a planning domain for using the linux command line
