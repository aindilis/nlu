<h2>Using the GF plug-in to produce Natural Language Translations of
Formal Proofs</h2>

By using the <cite>GF plug-in</cite>, formal proofs developed in <a
href="../">Alfa</a> can be translated to natural language. Currently,
translations to English, French and Swedish are available, and
more languages can be added by the user (but some linguistic
knowledge and familiarity with
<a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/">GF</a> is required).

<p>
The GF plug-in knows how to translate all Alfa built-in syntax (the
various forms of definitions and expressions), and provides default
translations of user-defined identifiers. However, to obtain nice text, the
user is expected to provide sutiable translations along with any new
definitions introduced in a proof. These translations are specified by
adding <em>grammatical annotations</em> to definitons. The
grammatical annotions are written in a simple language provided by GF.

<h3>An example</h3>

To activate the GF plugin, start Alfa with the following command:

<blockquote>
<code>alfa - -plugins GF</code>
</blockquote>

As a simple example, let's see how to translate the definition of
natural numbers and addition of natural numbers to English. We start
by defining these things in the usual way in Alfa:

<p>
<center><IMG  WIDTH=310 HEIGHT=209 SRC="P/gf0.gif" alt="[Def of Nat and +]"></center>

<p>
We can already obtain an English translation of this.
By selecting <strong>GF: Eng</strong> as the default declaration view
from the <strong>View</strong> menu, we get the following:
<p>
<center><IMG  WIDTH=437 HEIGHT=222 SRC="P/gf1.gif" alt="[GF: Eng view before adding grammatical annotations]"></center>
<p>
It is also possible to select definition(s) and apply
commands from the menu window to choose how to present them, e.g.,
<strong>GF: Show in Eng</strong>, <strong>GF: Show all
translation</strong>, <strong>Show default declaration
view</strong>. You can also select parts of expressions and apply
similar commands to them.
<p>
The next step is to tell GF how to translate <code>Nat</code> and
<code>+</code> to English.

<p>
We start by considering the translation of <code>Nat</code>.
Names of data types (sets) are usually
translated into nouns. In this case we want to use the phrase
<em>natural number</em>. Nouns may be used in both singular and plural
forms, so the translation have to indicate both forms. Fortunately,
the grammatical annotation language provides some auxiliary functions
to make this easy. In the case of regular nouns, for which the plural
form is obtained by adding an <code>s</code> to the end of the word,
it is particularly easy.
<p>
To enter the translation of <code>Nat</code> in Alfa, select the definition
of <code>Nat</code> (or just the name in the LHS of the definition)
and choose the command <strong>GF: Change Eng translation of
Nat</strong> in the menu window. You should now see a text editor
window containing the default translation of <code>Nat</code>:
<p>
<center><IMG  WIDTH=419 HEIGHT=320 SRC="P/gf2.gif" alt="[Editor with default grammatical annotation for Nat]"></center>
<p>
We can now replace the default translation with the desired one:
<p>
<center><IMG  WIDTH=333 HEIGHT=181 SRC="P/gf3.gif" alt="[Editor with user provided grammatical annotation for Nat]"></center>
<p>
Note that strings enclosed in quotes (<code>"</code>) should contain
single words and that the operator <code>++</code> is used to form
phrases containg more than one word. The function <code>regCN</code>
takes care of adding an <code>s</code> to the last word of the
argument phrase, in the places where it is used in the plural form.
<p>
When we press <strong>OK</strong>, the translation of the
definitions in the main window will be updated accordingly:

<p>
<center><IMG  WIDTH=439 HEIGHT=234 SRC="P/gf4.gif" alt="[Main window with improved translation of Nat]"></center>

<p>
Note that <code>Nat</code> is appropriately translated to <em>a
natural number</em> or <em>natural numbers</em> depending on the context.

<p>
We continue with the translation of the constructors <code>Zero</code>
and <code>Succ</code>. (To be able to select them and edit their
translations, you probably first have to switch back the declaration view to
<strong>Complete definitions</strong>.)
<p>
While the names of sets behave like nouns, constructors and other
elements of sets behave more like proper names. For
<code>Zero</code> and <code>Succ</code>, we enter the following
translations:

<blockquote><code>Zero@_  = mkPN "zero"</code></blockquote>
<blockquote><code>Succ@_ n = likeSucc "successor" n</code></blockquote>

The function <code>mkPN</code> creates simple proper names and
<code>likeSucc</code> constructs phrases like <em>the
<var>xxx</var> of <var>yyy</var></em>, where <var>xxx</var> is a
word and <var>yyy</var> is another proper name:
<p>
Finally, we add a translation for the operator <code>+</code>. We
choose to translate <code>a+b</code> to the phrase <code>the sum of a
and b</code>, which can be used as a proper name.

<blockquote><code>+ a b = likeSum "sum" a b</code></blockquote>

We now have completed our example, and the final translation to English is:
<p>

<p>

<h3>Known bugs and limitations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>After adding a new data type, the GF plug-in is not updated with
      information about the new constructors. Workaround: save and
      reopen the document.
  <li>User defined entities can only be used with the same arity they
      have in their definitions. For example, the arity of <code>+</code>
      above is 2, so it must always be applied to two
      arguments. Something like <code>map (+2) xs</code>, which could
      otherwise be perfectly reasonable, can at present not be translated
      correctly.
</ul>
