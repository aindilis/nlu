# if it thinks it's a perl document, try the perl parser, determine if
# the parse succeeded or failed, if it succeeded, go ahead and add it,
# if it failed, record and assert about that

# if it is a noun phrase, try to match it to wikipedia? dbpedia? yago?
# etc.

# need to come up with things that objects could be: - get a good
# ontology of these things

# so have an ontology of properties about something
