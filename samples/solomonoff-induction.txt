Computational aspects

Like Solomonoff induction, AIXI is incomputable. However, there are
computable approximations of it. One such approximation is AIXItl,
which performs as least as well as the provably best time t and space
l limited agent.[2] Another approximation to AIXI with a restricted
environment class is MC-AIXI(FAC-CTW), which has had some success
playing simple games such as partially observable Pac-Man.[5][6]
