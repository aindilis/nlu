Have a tag database - which includes each tag, and the description of
what the tag is supposed to mean - in order to resolve redundant tags,
etc.  Perhaps have a formal explication of the meaning of the tag as
well, allowing for CSP or what not in the estimation of the tags in
the first place.  Pre/post conditions?

Deal with the full range of possible tags, and learn more about
standoff, etc.

Write the function that takes an XML file and maps it into properties.
Write the function that stores the properties.  Deal with changes to
the source text - or make the buffer read only.
