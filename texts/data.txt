Contexts are composed of configurations of patterns, patterns are composed of configurations of variables, and variables are composed of configurations of first principle dimensional properties, such as quantifiers and qualitative adjective descriptive comparisons, and those relational frameworks can simulate the meat of metaphor, as two analogies juxtaposed by similar relational operators that form a cross-domain relation in an overlap of meaning or intention or something else.
Analogies mimic patterns across contexts via Cross-Domain Relations.
Cross-Domain Relations go from domain to domain when the range is the same, as an overlap.
That is the basis of Analogical Reasoning.
If data has recognizable features, it is a pattern.
Repetition is what makes a symmetry, and is what makes a pattern's features recognizable.
Information is a symphony of symbolism and symmetry.
